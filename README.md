Gui-tool for Kotlin scripting 

Instructions for building and running the gui-tool

Application is built for windows using javafx. The executable jar is present in the zip file along with the source code.
Install [liberica jdk 11+](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#/java-11-lts) for windows (or open/oracle jdk along with openfx). Make sure JAVA_HOME is set up to the jdk directory.
Make sure Kotlin SDK is set up in the system and KOTLIN_HOME is set to that directory. You can install Kotlin sdk from [scoop](https://scoop.sh/), just run `scoop install kotlin`. 
To build the source simply run the Main.kt file after opening the project on any IDE. Run `gradlew jar` in IDE terminal to generate executable jar. You can find the executable in the build/libs folder.
